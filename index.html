<p>I did not find an existing Q/A on the subject.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/308472/3627607">this answer</a> on another meta post I have doubts.</p>

<p>Usually when I flag a post and feel the flag is not obvious or need explanation I comment under the post to inform the author of why I flag it with the idea a moderator will also see this comment and will have more information on my point of view.</p>

<p>Am I wrong with this assumption or is it a correct way to inform the moderators while teaching authors at the same time?</p>

<p>I'm not saying everyone should do it like this or wishing to change the system; I just wish feedback on how I handle flagging usually.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do moderators see comments under flagged posts?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are 3 view states for a post. </p>

<ol>
<li>Collapsed. This is the default. We <strong>don't</strong> see any comments.</li>
<li>Expanded. We can click a collapsed post to reveal more information. Here, we see a "show n more comments" link, but still <strong>can't</strong> see individual comments.</li>
<li>Expanded, with comments. Upon clicking the "show n more comments" link, we'd end up in this state, and <strong>can</strong> <em>now</em> see the comments on a post.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, reading between the lines on the comments under your post...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On low traffic tags it could take month before a question comes on hold or be cleaned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're asking a moderator to place a question on hold, or delete it, you're already raising a custom flag. As jon alluded to in comments, and given the above (how moderators don't always see comments on flags), I'd include as much information in the flag as possible (even copy/ paste what you left as a comment, if you wish).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It could take years for a bad answer [... to be removed]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A bad (wrong) answer should be downvoted, not removed. It shouldn't take domain knowledge to spot answers-which-aren't-answers.</p>
