<p>I don't post very much as I'm not anywhere near a professional developer or programmer; however, whenever I do, I am increasingly frustrated by what I view as requests to append or re-examine my code, which does not lead to any satisfactory answers.  Maybe this is paranoia or an inferiority complex on my part; however, it's still something I feel is legitimate for me.</p>

<p>My example is a recent question of mine - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31525228/how-can-i-get-text-content-to-resize-correctly-when-using-fancybox-2">How can I get text content to resize correctly when using Fancybox 2?</a></p>

<p>I feel I presented my problem in the best way possible given my knowledge, presented a few attempts to work through my query, again using the full extent of my knowledge, and also have provided updates to show I am still trying to think through my question.  Frustratingly however, I received a downvote with no feedback as to why.</p>

<p>I suppose I have a couple of questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>How can I improve this question given that I feel I have reached the
extent of my knowledge?</li>
<li>How can I decipher what my downvote was for and act accordingly?</li>
<li>What else can I do to get a satisfactory answer to my question given that I feel I have presented a well thought out question.</li>
</ul>

<p>After talking with another SO user (in the real world!!!) we have both discussed how sometimes, users expect those of us with a little less knowledge to be able to answer their own questions - almost like a "you'll never learn if you don't figure it out" tough love aspect.</p>

<p>Often I post because I have reached the limit of my deductive abilities, and I have no other outlet to solve problems, so I feel I should ask the user base for advice.</p>

<p>There are good people who will comment on what else you need to add to your question to make it clearer and better. Look for comments that tell you things like, "you need to add this" or "isn't <code>variable1</code> supposed to be this?" and stuff like that. They can really help make your post better and give you more knowledge to apply to your future questions. As of this post you have a score of 2, which means your question is clear and shows research and probably matches the requirements of the <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/help">Help Center</a>.</p>

<p>If you gain a downvote, re-read your question and see if you can find any holes in your question. Maybe you are missing some code, or the question needs more information. Not every time are you actually at the extent of your knowledge. There are usually places a lot people can miss and no one is a perfect question maker here. <strong>Honestly, improve your question with the help of extra knowledge that may come from other fellow users if you think your question has maximum quality. There are times you will be proven wrong...</strong></p>

<p>You really can't. You need to see if the downvoter has posted a comment on why the question needs fixing or the reason for downvoting. If you get a downvote, re-examine your question for any holes or mistakes in your question. If you can't see any, just wait to see if any helpful comments come. Downvotes are given because the question is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Not clear</p></li>
<li><p>Has shown no effort/research</p></li>
<li><p>Can be flagged (spam, rude, unclear, too broad, off-topic (duplicate is an exception))</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can also visit the <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/asking">Help Center</a> for more information on how to make a good, well-received question.</p>

<p>Make your question as clear as possible and hope that someone with good expertise on your subject will find your mistake and fix it. That's really my only advice.</p>
